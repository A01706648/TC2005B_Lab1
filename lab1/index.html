                    As we saw that html5 Is the advanced version of html4, it has many new tags and features which was not present in html4, on another side we can see that html4 is more browser compatible compare to html5 so our choice for selection should be according to product development requirements if we are fixing some bugs on the old legacy website so at that place we cannot go with html5 because of compatibility issues .while in case of new web development which is the next-generation website we should always use the latest version. I hope now you must have got a fairer idea of both Html5 vs Html4. Stay tuned to our blog for more articles like these.
