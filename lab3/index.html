            As a software engineer what is your recommendation on using !importantin a CSS? 
        </h2>
        <h3>
            I recommand to use External Document to import the CSS, because we can change the whole sit's style only by change the CSS file
        </h3>
        <h2>
            If you put a background image on an HTML page, why should it be chosen carefully?
        </h2>
        <h3>
            We should pay attention to the ratio and resolution, to make sure the image will fit the page.
        </h3>
        <h2>
            As a software engineer, what is your recommendation when choosing the units of a style property between%, px, and pt?
        </h2>
        <h3>
            it is better choose the %, which is the percentage of the page, and will be relative. Then it will look the same in different devices
        </h3>
        <h2>
            Why does using a minimized version of CSS improve site performance?
        </h2>
        <h3>
            The minimized can reduce the size of the css file. And when we load the page, we will load the css file too. If css file is smaller, then the load will be faster.
