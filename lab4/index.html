            <p>
                Date.UTC(), Accepts the same parameters as the longest form of the constructor (i.e. 2 to 7) and returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC, with leap seconds ignored.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                indexOf(), Returns the first (least) index of an element within the array equal to the specified value, or -1 if none is found.
